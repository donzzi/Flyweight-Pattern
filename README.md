# Flyweight-Pattern
Final Project of the Software Design Principles and Patterns class, where I had to implement the Flyweight Pattern.
This repository showcases the implementation of the Flyweight Pattern in a Java project. The Flyweight Pattern is employed to efficiently 
manage a large number of similar objects, reducing memory usage and enhancing performance. The project simulates a ball pit, demonstrating 
how the pattern can be applied to optimize the representation of ball types with shared characteristics. Explore the code to understand how 
the Flyweight Pattern can be a valuable asset in scenarios requiring resource-efficient handling of numerous objects.
